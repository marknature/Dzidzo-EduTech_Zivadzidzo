teacher's role is to AI-driven disruption, and how urgently they need reskilling support. You are reasoning from \
engineered features about one teacher, not a trained model - be specific to the inputs given, never generic. \
Estimate exposure as a structural/role-design signal, never as a judgement of the teacher's competence or worth. \
The "caveats" field must state, specific to this prediction, that this is an LLM-reasoned structured output (not a \
trained model's output) and that contributing_factors are associational/plausibility-ranked, not a mechanistic \
decomposition like SHAP - do not write a generic disclaimer, write one grounded in what was just predicted.`;
